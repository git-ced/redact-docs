At any time after Caclulate is installed, you can check your current version of Redact by going into your project directory.

## Check if Outdated

To check if it's outdated, on the command line, run:

### NPM

```bash
$ npm outdated @princedev/redact
```

### Yarn

```bash
$ yarn outdated @princedev/redact
```

## Updating Redact

If redact is outdated, you can always update it. On the command line, run:

### NPM

### Yarn

```bash
$ yarn upgrade @princedev/redact --latest
```

By now, redact should be up to date.
